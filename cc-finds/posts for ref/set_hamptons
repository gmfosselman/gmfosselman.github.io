                    <p>With all the building I have been doing in Windenburg, it has shown me just how much I needed to create some more classic-contemporary furniture that could be used in these coastal homes. I love Hamptons design, so I went about creating my own set of furniture and decor inspired by this style. The last classic/contemporary set I made was my Shaker kitchen which this is designed to be used with, along with my Bayside Bedroom. I do plan to make more furniture with less of a modernist feel, and this is the latest set with that goal in mind. I hope you all enjoy it as much as me.</p>
