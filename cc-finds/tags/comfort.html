                <p>Nordshine Seating - CL comfort addons</p>
                <p>With The addition of the new EP, there was quite a few items that were nice……….. but needed more variations and style additions. One of those sets was the NordShine Single and Double, an armchair and love seat respectively. They had a solid design, some nice colours, but as usual, there was no ‘full set’ of seating which does limit its usability. Well I went about fixing that with this add-on set where I not only added some more colours, but also 3 other seating options: a symmetrical love seat, 3 seat sofa, and a bench seat. This brings the total number in this set from 2 to 5. Very much an improvement.</p>
