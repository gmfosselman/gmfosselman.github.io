                    <p>Well, I think I out-did myself this time. I seem to be taking on ever-increasingly complex sets that get bigger as I get more experience. As you can see, a kitchen is probably one of the most complex sets you can make for The Sims 4. Totalling just over 51 unique meshes in 38 package files, this by far outstrips Atwood Living for my biggest set to date. I will probably hold that title for some time to come. I has been a labour of love, and I hope that dedication shows in the final product. I am usually at a point when i finish these projects that I never want to see my content again. However, that is not the case with this kitchen. I still love using it, despite the amount of agony it has caused me. So I hope you all enjoy it at least as much as me (which is a lot).</p>
